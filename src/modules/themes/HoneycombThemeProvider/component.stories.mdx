# HoneycombThemeProvider

The `HoneycombThemeProvider` component lets you easily pick one of the many themes this library
supports and change it anywhere in your component tree following the rules of our design system.

All the props this component accepts are optional and will generally default to picking our Gold
Light theme. Read on for a more detailed explanation.

## Family

The `family` prop can be `gold` or `sea`, and defaults to `gold`.

## Variant and default variant

The `variant` prop can be `light`, `dark` or `accent`. If this prop is provided, Honeycomb will use
it. Otherwise, it will use `defaultVariant`, which can be `light` or `dark`, and defaults to
`light`.

`defaultVariant` tells Honeycomb to figure out what are the user's OS theme settings and adjust to
them if possible, defaulting to `defaultVariant`'s value if checking those settings is not possible.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Responsive to OS dark mode settings">
    <HoneycombThemeProvider family="gold" defaultVariant="light">
      <Example text="Responsive to OS dark mode settings" />
    </HoneycombThemeProvider>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Accent themes

Accent themes are treated in a special way. If you se your `variant` to `accent` inside a context
with a light theme, the result will not be surprising.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Accent inside light theme">
    <HoneycombThemeProvider family="gold" variant="light">
      <Example text="Light theme">
        <HoneycombThemeProvider variant="accent">
          <Example text="Accent theme inside light theme" />
        </HoneycombThemeProvider>
      </Example>
    </HoneycombThemeProvider>
  </Story>
</Preview>

However, if you use `accent` inside a context with a dark theme, the dark theme will be used anyway
and your change will be ignored.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Accent inside dark theme">
    <HoneycombThemeProvider family="gold" variant="dark">
      <Example text="Dark theme">
        <HoneycombThemeProvider variant="accent">
          <Example text="Accent theme inside dark theme" />
        </HoneycombThemeProvider>
      </Example>
    </HoneycombThemeProvider>
  </Story>
</Preview>

In the `sea` family, however, `accent` always defaults to whatever the variant is in upper contexts,
or `light` if none can be found.

## Nesting

`HoneycombThemeProvider` is aware of whether it has been previously used in your component tree, and
will keep the values used by its ascendants unless you explicitly change them.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Nesting">
    <HoneycombThemeProvider family="gold" defaultVariant="dark">
      <Example text="Responsive to OS theme (Gold)">
        <HoneycombThemeProvider family="sea">
          <Example text="Sea family inside Gold family" />
        </HoneycombThemeProvider>
      </Example>
    </HoneycombThemeProvider>
  </Story>
</Preview>

Honeycomb's priorities are always your props first. This makes it possible to make it go back to
checking the system's dark mode settings after setting a forced theme in an upper context.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Nesting defaultVariant">
    <HoneycombThemeProvider family="gold" variant="dark">
      <Example text="Always dark">
        <HoneycombThemeProvider family="sea" defaultVariant="dark">
          <Example text="Responsive to OS theme" />
        </HoneycombThemeProvider>
      </Example>
    </HoneycombThemeProvider>
  </Story>
</Preview>
